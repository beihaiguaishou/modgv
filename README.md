# modgv

Converts 'go mod graph' output into [GraphViz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/)'s DOT language.

- takes no options or arguments
- it reads the output generated by ‚Äúgo mod graph‚Äù on stdin
- generates a DOT language and writes to stdout

## Usage:

```bash
go mod graph | modgv | dot -Tpng -o graph.png
```

For each module:
- the node representing the greatest version (i.e., the version chosen by Go's MVS algorithm) is colored green
- other nodes, which aren't in the final build list, are colored grey

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/lucasepe/modgv/modgv
